## Number + Compare
## Example 1 
int5=7; 
let diffFrom19 = Math.abs(int5 - 19);
const diffDouble = 2 * diffFrom19;

if (int5 > 19) {
    console.log(diffDouble);
} else {
    console.log(diffFrom19)
}
//12

## Example 2 
let score = 32;
let msg = "";

msg=(score>1337)? "This is a new highscore":"You need more points to beat the highscore" 

console.log(msg)
//You need more points to beat the highscore
