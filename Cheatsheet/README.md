Purpose: to find or create/initiate;  
b) (Info) button in green color provides General Information in this window as well as essential information about each button, e.g. 'True/False' 'Info' explains the basics of 'True/False' (so-called Boolean value);
c) In violet, there is (isNaN/typeof). 
Purpose: to clarify the kind of input we are dealing with; 
d) 'c' is to clear; 
e) '=' is to see a model/syntax with examples for a solution; 
f) '+' is for combinations (e.g. (String) (+) (Method) (=)); Note: the options for combinations provide the basics covered in our course;
g) '-' is to remove (e.g. to remove a part of an array, press (Array) (-) (=)); Note: the options for combinations provide the basics covered in our course;
i) '><' is to replace (e.g. to replace a part of an array, press (Array) (><) (=)); Note: the options for combinations provide the basics covered in our course;
